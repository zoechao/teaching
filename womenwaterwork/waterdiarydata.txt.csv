Perhaps we should add an option to specify the number of times an action was taken, such as 3 glasses of drinking water from the tap, 2 liters from a fountain, or anything else that might happen more than once a day.  In this case, I added the volume of the two uses, but I would have more accurate data if I could see how much each flush amounts to, and then see the total number of flushes each day. I could either add each action individually, or make note that I did it multiple times. Also,  a friend flushed the toilet in my apartment today, but I figured it still contributes to my total water use. Is this a fair assumption?"

I cannot access my electric bills, but estimate that I use about 0.75 kW per hour based on my bulb size.  At spectrum.ieee.org, researchers found that we use approximately 95 L per kW-hour of electricity.  So my home consumption is about 142.5 L or 38 gallons.  I also spent two hours at my healing office and used about 0.12 kW for indirect consumption of about 3 gallons.  I also purchased a burrito from Frontier and bought groceries at Smith's and spent about 30 minutes total in these buildings.  They were very well-lit and most likely consumed quite a bit of electricity.  I cannot track down a clear figure for average electricity consumed in retail shops, though one figures places Starbuck's consumption at 5.84 kW-H per square foot each day.  I will ballpark that I indirectly consumed about 1 gallon of water from using the electricity in these shops."

According to Discover, one sheet of paper requires about 3 gallons to produce, so I probably indirectly consumed about 3 gallons here.  The burrito had a wheat tortilla, potatoes, cheese, eggs, and green chiles.  According to ""Water Content of Things"" from ""The World's Water,"" All these items combined would require about 10,600 gallons of water per kilogram of food.  A burrito is probably about .4 kilograms, so 4,240 gallons of water would be embedded in this burrito.  This number is huge!  I wonder if it is correct.  It seems possible, since growing crops and processing and transporting the food would use a lot of water.  But I hope this doesn't throw off comparison calculations!  Later, I bought some corn tortillas wrapped in plastic and two chocolate bars wrapped in paper and got a receipt.  The wrapping adds about 4 gallons of water, and the ingredients may add up to 425 gallons of water.  I wonder if this is anywhere near accurate.  It is very tricky to track this down and attempt to compare, so I apologize if this is off the charts!"
